### This is a Co-op VR game made in team of 4 students during our last year at Epita !

In a similar fashion as [hacktag](http://www.hacktag-thegame.com/), this is a two player game where one gets to enjoy
a VR experience by being an agent on the field, while the other plays as the hacker on their mobile/laptop!
Both player need each other to cooperate and get through the various obstacles standing in their way, to reach the end
of the level within the time limit !
